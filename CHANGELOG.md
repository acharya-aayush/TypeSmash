# TypeSmash Development Changelog

## May 1, 2025 - Project Initiation

**03:14 AM**  
Project conception inspired by monkey type as I tried my usual typetest routine. Initial research and project planning began.

**10:27 AM**  
Continued research on typing test implementation methodologies in JavaScript. Gathered resources and references.

**02:45 PM**  
Established project structure and repository. Project naming evolution: "SpeedTyper" → "TypeTest" → "TypeSmash". Decided on UI direction inspired by MonkeyType.com's clean interface.

**11:52 PM**  
Implemented basic typing test functionality with 15-second mode. Added character-by-character verification system for accurate typing assessment.

## May 2, 2025 - Feature Development

**11:20 AM**  
Extended test options with additional time-based modes (30-second, 60-second) and word count modes (10, 20, 50, 100 words). Focused on building a comprehensive typing experience.

**01:23 PM**  
Developed statistics tracking system to calculate and display WPM, accuracy, and character count metrics. Implemented standard WPM calculation (5 characters = 1 word).

**06:48 PM**  
Added audio feedback for typing with keyboard sound effects to enhance user experience and typing satisfaction.

**11:11 PM**  
Implemented localStorage integration for persistent stats storage. Resolved initial challenges with data persistence architecture.

## May 3, 2025 - Code Mode Development

**02:37 AM**  
Began implementing "Code Mode" feature to allow users to practice typing code snippets in Python and JavaScript. Collected appropriate code samples for different difficulty levels.

**10:05 AM**  
Encountered technical challenges with Code Mode implementation, particularly with syntax highlighting and special character handling in programming languages.

**03:33 PM**  
Continued troubleshooting Code Mode functionality. Focused on resolving tab key behavior and indentation handling in code snippets.

**08:12 PM**  
Refined user interface with improved styling and dark theme implementation. Maintained MonkeyType-inspired aesthetic while adding custom visual elements.

## May 4, 2025 - Project Scope Adjustment & Zoro Mode Inception

**01:34 AM**  
Strategic scope reduction: Removed 30s, 60s time modes and retained core 15s timed and 20 word count modes. Made the difficult decision to discontinue Code Mode development due to technical complexities.

**11:46 AM**  
Conceptualized "Zoro Mode" as a creative alternative typing experience inspired by One Piece. Envisioned falling words that players would "slash" by typing them before they reach the bottom.

**04:56 PM**  
Began Zoro Mode implementation as an experimental feature. Created canvas-based system for animating falling words.

**09:27 PM**  
Completed basic word falling mechanics and interaction system for Zoro Mode. Initial prototype showed promising engagement potential.

## May 5, 2025 - Zoro Mode Enhancement

**03:21 AM**  
Implemented difficulty progression system for Zoro Mode based on One Piece world locations: East Blue (easy), Paradise (medium), Warlord_Commander (hard), and Yonko (expert).

**12:00 PM**  
Developed power-up system for Zoro Mode including "Onigiri" (health restoration), "Haki" (temporary invincibility), and "Ashura" (screen clearing functionality).

**05:43 PM**  
Added game over screen for Zoro Mode displaying final score, level reached, and maximum combo achieved.

**10:57 PM**  
Created categorized word lists in zorotypinggamewords.json file to support the difficulty tiers in Zoro Mode.

## May 6, 2025 - Bug Fixing & Documentation

**02:22 AM**  
Identified and began troubleshooting critical bug preventing Zoro mode statistics from displaying properly in the history view.

**11:10 AM**  
Resolved Zoro mode statistics display issue by fixing event listener implementation on the filter button.

**01:45 PM**  
Began documentation process, creating README and documentation files to provide comprehensive project information.

**04:30 PM**  
Reflected on project evolution from standard typing test to the unexpected development of Zoro Mode as a standout feature.

**07:13 PM**  
Performed final quality assurance checks. Fixed minor UI update bug in Zoro Mode power-up display system and removed debug console logs.

**09:52 PM**  
Project completion: TypeSmash finalized with both standard typing test functionality and the innovative Zoro Mode, representing a unique combination of typing practice and gamified experience.

## May 7, 2025 - Post-Launch Bug Fix

**02:15 PM**  
Identified critical bug in Zoro Mode where the "Play Again" functionality after game over was not working properly due to the game state not being properly reactivated.

**03:40 PM**  
Fixed Zoro Mode reset issue by properly setting the active state flag in the restartZoroGame function, ensuring players can continue playing multiple rounds without having to exit and reactivate the mode.
