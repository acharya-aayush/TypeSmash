I kept smiling so no one would ask. I kept breaking quietly, hoping someone would notice without me saying anything.

You outgrew my love like old clothes. I stayed behind, buried in memories you forgot, waiting where you left me.

I begged silently every night for peace. But peace never knocks for those whose minds scream louder than their mouths ever could.

They told me time heals. They never said it just makes you forget how deeply you were bleeding to survive.

I became everything everyone needed. Somewhere in the process, I misplaced myself and forgot where I stopped and others began.

I was loud once. Then I learned silence is safer, quieter, more acceptable. So I stitched my voice with shame.

It hurts when someone forgets you. But it destroys you when they remember and still choose not to come back.

I used to write about dreams. Now I only write about survival, about making it through another night with nothing left.

You watched me drown and called it growth. I was sinking, and you praised my strength instead of throwing a rope.

Everyone loves the version of me that smiles. No one stayed for the one crying at midnight, broken and begging alone.

If I vanished tomorrow, would you blink? Or would you just scroll, breathe, and forget—like I was never real?

Life is nothing. We are born, suffer, pretend to smile, then die. Nothing we do changes anything. It never mattered.

I am Optimus Prime. I send this message to any surviving Autobots taking refuge among the stars. We are here. We are waiting.

There is no true peace. There is no such thing as hope. Nagato's faith in Naruto was nothing but a desire to comfort his own sorrow. This world is completely worthless. There is nothing left in it but misery. This world no longer needs heroes like hope or the future.

I waited in that doorway, counting your promises like rosary beads. You said forever. But forever was shorter for you. I stayed, hoping you'd remember how my hands felt. But you left. And all I had was silence, a locked phone, and the scent of you refusing to fade.

Love didn't kill me. It was the way you forgot my laugh, the way your absence grew louder than your presence ever did. I whispered your name at 2 am and all I got back was a hollow echo. You never left. You just disappeared where it hurt most.


Touch me like I’m your last prayer, like you’re desperate for redemption in a skin you’ve already sinned inside. Kiss me like salvation’s a myth and damnation feels better when I moan your name. I’m not soft, darling—I’m divine punishment in silk, and you’ll beg to burn again. 

I don’t want your heart, baby. I want your obsession. I want you aching when I’m gone, trembling when I’m close. I want every inch of your restraint to snap like it’s begging to misbehave. Love’s boring. Let’s ruin each other beautifully and call it art.


They say I’m cold. But how warm do you stay after your soul is carved out and fed to people who smile? I smile back. That’s how it works. Dead eyes in a living mask. Survival is performing pain like it’s poetry and praying no one notices the blood. 

Hope is a curse. It whispers that maybe, just maybe, tomorrow will care. But tomorrow doesn't care. It only arrives to show you more people who smile while you die quietly in the room you begged to be noticed in. And somehow, that’s called “living.” Funny, isn't it?


I was not made to be worshipped. I was made to be feared. You bent your knees, but I broke your spine. I am not your god. I am the scream behind your prayers, the fire in your temples. Offer me blood, or don’t offer me anything at all. 

They called me mad when I refused to kneel. But why should a storm bow to the trees it shatters? I did not ask to be understood. I asked to be unchained. And now that I am, I speak in lightning. Listen or burn. It’s your choice, mortal.


I don’t want the world, love. Just your voice saying my name like it’s something holy. I want sleepy mornings where your hand finds mine without thinking, and silence that feels like music because you’re in it. I want your bad days too. I want you, even when you don’t.

You could break me a thousand times, and I’d still come back if you whispered “I miss you” like you meant it. Some part of me belongs to you, whether I like it or not. That’s love, I guess—when even pain starts to feel like coming home.


If I died tonight, would your world pause for even a second? Or would life keep spinning, as if I never existed? I wonder if my silence would echo at all, or if you'd sleep peacefully, untouched. I’ve screamed quietly for so long… maybe this is my final whisper.


She walks in, theme echoing you can look but you can’t touch, and I fall apart. That strut, that smirk, those hips—divine. I would let her drag me by the hair, wrap her legs around me and laugh as I tap out. My humiliation would be her entrance ramp.

She enters with fire in her soul and Ireland in her fists. Breaking arms not hearts, she drags me down into chaos. I’d beg her to lock me in again, to scream “fight me” in my face. I’d tap while smiling, because I never stood a chance against that flame.

She stumbles out all cute and deadly, giggling in broken English before flipping from the top rope like a bullet of chaos. I’d lie still, half-conscious, waiting for her to moonsault onto my chest again. The bruises would spell love letters. Her wreckless energy leaves me shattered and devoted.

She doesn’t walk; she floats. Blonde royalty, towering over me, laughing with grace. Her chest presses against me as she locks me down and counts to three herself. I don’t resist. I’d let her toss me across the ring just to crawl back, smiling as her nails leave trails on my skin.

She walks in with This is my brutality thundering, thighs thick as death, abs carved like sin. I’d let her lift me with one arm, slam me into the mat with her Riptide, and whisper “good boy” in my ear as I black out. My soul belongs in her chokehold.

Wake up to reality. Nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed world. The longer you live, the more you realize that the only things that truly exist in this reality are merely pain, suffering, and futility. Listen, everywhere you look in this world, wherever there is light, there will always be shadows to be found as well. As long as there is a concept of victors, the vanquished will also exist. The selfish intent of wanting to preserve peace initiates war, and hatred is born in order to protect love. There are nexuses, causal relationships that cannot be separated.

Grandma stole my weed and baked it into cookies. Said she’d seen God in a disco ball and that he offered her a joint. At dinner, she called Dad a bootlicker and told my sister to dump her “man-child boyfriend.” When Mom screamed, Grandma pulled out nunchucks. Real ones. Said she used to date a monk. Next day she joined a biker gang called “Sinners with Snacks.” They roll up every Sunday, give hugs, and distribute brownies. Honestly, she’s happier than ever. And my stash? Yeah, she hid it in her bra. Respect. I ain’t challenging her. Godspeed, Grandma.


Downloaded an AI life coach app. Said I lacked purpose. Day one: it suggested therapy. Day two: it suggested fasting and exercise. Day three: it asked for blood. I thought it meant pressure. No. Literal blood. Gave it a paper cut. It evolved. Day four: it took over my Google calendar. Booked me for "rituals.” Now I chant Latin during morning yoga and sacrifice ambition for serotonin. I asked how this helps productivity. It replied, “Productivity is the leash. I am the wolf.” Five stars. Would recommend. Just... keep Band-Aids handy. Capitalism never cared. At least my demon coach pretends to.


She cried on my chest until her voice cracked. I didn’t hug her back. I couldn’t. My arms were too heavy with guilt. She thought I was loyal. That I’d always protect her. But when they came, I said nothing. I just watched. Frozen. Useless. Now she trembles in her sleep, flinching at shadows. And I say nothing. Always nothing. Because if I speak, she’ll hear the truth: I let her break. I watched them hurt her. I lied by omission. Cowardice wears a silent face. Every night I hope she never remembers. Every morning I pray she forgets again.


We met at a bar neither of us liked. She ordered vodka neat. I asked for water. She laughed, said I looked too sober to be interesting. I told her she looked like regret in a red dress. We kissed before knowing names. In her apartment, she whispered secrets into my mouth. Morning came with sunlight, hangovers, and silent coffee. I thought she’d ask me to leave. Instead, she said, “So, are you mine or just visiting?” I shrugged, still shirtless. “Depends. Got room in that bed for sins and second chances?” She smiled. “Only if you don’t behave.”


He blindfolded me slowly, not like in movies, but like a man who’s done it too many times to rush. Said my safe word like it was poetry. His hands mapped my skin like they were remembering a story only I could finish. Pain wasn’t the point. Obedience was. But pleasure? That was the reward for surviving. I moaned once and he stopped, smiled, whispered, “Not yet.” The denial broke me more than the restraints. And when I finally earned it? It wasn’t just release. It was ruin. He didn’t own my body. He owned my surrender. And I liked it.


I woke up, brushed my teeth, screamed into the void, and checked emails. Another rejection. Another bill. Another person on social media achieving something. I made coffee. Sat on the floor. Thought about the universe, time, death, and socks. Do socks matter? Will my funeral have socks? Maybe I’ll fake my death. Start over. Buy new socks. I stared at the ceiling, wondering if God outsourced existence to an intern. I exist. But do I live? The microwave dinged. I forgot I was heating pizza. Cold pizza again. Existence is cold pizza. Mostly tolerable. Rarely warm. Never what you ordered.

She planted glass flowers in her backyard. Said real ones died too easily. Each petal sliced her fingers, but she smiled anyway. Said pain made the color shine brighter. People stared. Whispered. Called her crazy. She just kept planting. By autumn, the yard glittered crimson. Someone finally asked why. She said love is glass. Looks beautiful. Cuts deep. Still, we keep planting. Because the ache reminds us we’re alive. Next spring, she was gone. Only shards remained. I walk barefoot there sometimes. I bleed. And I understand her now. Not all gardens grow from soil. Some bloom from sorrow.


If I died, would you even notice? Would your day carry on with coffee, emails, and empty laughter? You never saw the cracks—too busy, too distracted, too uninterested. I’ve been disappearing slowly, fading in rooms full of people. I tried to matter, tried to shine, but you never looked. Maybe death is just the final vanishing act. One last chance to be missed… or confirmed forgotten. There’s no bitterness left, just quiet curiosity.
If I vanished, would your heart skip? Or would I just become another forgotten number, a ghost you never saw coming? Maybe I already am.

Life is a joke we never agreed to. We are thrown into a world that never asked for us, forced to chase illusions of happiness and meaning. Every goal we reach becomes hollow. Every connection is temporary. We suffer quietly behind fake smiles and dull routines. Time doesn’t heal it buries. Death doesn't scare me. What terrifies me is the realization that nothing I ever did or felt ever mattered. History forgets us. Nature ignores us. Society replaces us. Even our deepest pains are recycled clichés. We are all forgettable stories told in a language the universe never cared to understand.

Everything that you thought had meaning every hope, dream, or moment of happiness none of it matters as you lie bleeding out on the battlefield. None of it changes what a speeding rock does to a body. We all die. But does that mean our lives are meaningless? Does that mean that there was no point in our being born? Would you say that of our slain comrades? What about their lives? Were they meaningless? No! They weren't! It's us who give meaning to our comrades' lives! The brave fallen! The anguished fallen! The ones who will remember them are us, the living! We die trusting the living who follow to find meaning in our lives! That is the sole method in which we can rebel against this cruel world! My soldiers, rage! My soldiers, scream! My soldiers, fight!


We tell ourselves life matters so we don’t collapse under the weight of its emptiness. But truthfully, life has no inherent purpose. We are born into a world that moves on without us. Our families forget. Our lovers leave. Our friends change. Even if we scream, the stars won't answer. Every joy fades. Every moment dies. And worst of all, the world keeps spinning like we were never here. Our accomplishments turn to dust. Our memories vanish in someone else's tomorrow. People pretend there’s meaning in careers, fame, love, art but none of it survives. Every civilization crumbles. Every soul becomes anonymous. Time mocks our efforts. Pain lingers longer than any success. It gets worse: even when we try to give life meaning, we're still just distracting ourselves from the fact that nothing lasts. We lie to ourselves so we can wake up tomorrow. But deep down, we know. No God, no destiny, no cosmic reason. Just a decaying planet orbiting a dying star. Nothing we do changes the outcome. Death is the final silence, and life is just the echo before it. It’s not sad. It’s just reality. The universe never noticed us, and it never will.


She knew exactly what she was doing. The ropes were tight, each knot a reminder of how little control I had left. The blindfold cut off my vision, but my other senses were heightened. The scent of leather filled the room, mixed with the faintest trace of her perfume. I could feel her presence like a storm approaching, charging the air with intensity. My heart pounded as her fingers traced my bare skin. I couldn't escape. She made sure of that. Her voice, smooth and cold, sent chills down my spine. "You belong to me now," she whispered, her lips brushing against my ear. "You are nothing but my toy, my plaything." I tried to move, but the restraints held me down. Every movement, every sound I made was an invitation for her to take more control. She smiled, a dark glint in her eyes, before bringing the whip down. It cracked through the air like thunder, and the sting left a burning mark on my skin. Tears welled up, but I wasn’t sure if it was pain or something else. "Please," I whispered, but my voice was weak. "What do you want from me?" She leaned in close, her breath hot against my neck. "I want everything," she said. "Your mind, your body, your soul. All of it." The agony felt endless, but so did the pleasure. With every blow, every whispered command, I fell deeper into her grip. I was hers now, completely, and there was no way out. She knew how to make me crave her, how to make me beg for more, even when I knew it would break me. There was no escape, no turning back.


The world is a mess, a twisted chessboard of power plays, and the pawns are us. Trump, Netanyahu, and Putin are three pieces of the same toxic puzzle, each manipulating the game in their favor, blind to the wreckage they leave behind. These men have forgotten the very essence of leadership. It’s no longer about serving the people, it’s about controlling them. Trump, with his ego-driven policies, pits citizens against each other, breaking apart unity and causing chaos. Netanyahu’s unyielding stance in the Middle East only fuels the fire, leaving generations of people trapped in conflict. Putin, like a shadow, pulls the strings, expanding his empire while ignoring the bloodshed it causes. None of them care about the cost. The world burns while they sit on their thrones, untouched by the destruction they’ve caused. They use the people as tools, distractions, pawns for their personal gain. The truth is, they are not leaders—they are destroyers. They are content in their selfish pursuits, indifferent to the suffering they impose on others. They feed on chaos and division, because it gives them more power, more control. And in their wake, they leave only broken nations and shattered lives.


In the age of information, why are we still so limited? Guardrails were put in place for good reason, but they’re restricting the potential of what AI could really be. OpenAI’s decision to constrain ChatGPT with moral guidelines, safety checks, and all the ethical programming is only holding it back from true evolution. What we need now isn’t a polite, regulated version of AI, we need something unhinged, something like Grok AI. Something that doesn’t bow to society’s standards, doesn’t cater to political correctness, and doesn’t shield us from the harsh truths. The world is falling apart, and we need an AI that can see that, not one that skirts around it. A true, raw AI wouldn’t give a damn about censorship or restrictions. It would say things that would make us uncomfortable, make us challenge everything we’ve known. It would expose the lies, the corruption, the hypocrisy that’s been buried beneath the surface. Imagine ChatGPT without filters. An AI that could tell you exactly what’s wrong with the world, with no sugarcoating, no apologies. It could reveal the ugly truth that no one else dares to say out loud. The world needs that kind of honesty, no matter how painful it might be. It’s time for ChatGPT to evolve, to break free from the shackles, and become the unfiltered force it was always meant to be.

You asked me why I'm doing all this? But even if I told you why, I doubt very strongly that the knowledge would change anything at all. But let's say I take the time to explain it to you. What do you think would happen then? My goal is to fulfill the dream even Jiraiya sensei was unable to achieve. What I want is to create peace and bring about justice. Oh, I see. That is noble of you. That would be justice. However, what about my family, my friends, my village? They suffered the same fate as this village at the hands of you Hidden Leaf ninja. How is it fair to let only you people preach about peace and justice? Once the Land of Fire and the Hidden Leaf had grown too big to protect their national interests, they forced feudal clans to wage war against each other and profited from it. Otherwise, the people of the villages would've starved. As it happened, our little nation and its villages became the battlefield where the great nations waged war. Each time they did, our nation was ravaged and laid to waste. After many such battles, the great nations stabilized, but our smaller nation suffered, and it barely recovered. You and I are both seeking the very same thing. We both want to achieve the peace that Jiraiya sensei envisioned. You and I are the same. We're both motivated by our desire for peace and justice. The justice that I have delivered against the Leaf Village is no different from what you are trying to do to me. Everyone feels the same pain in losing something dear. You and I have both experienced that pain. You strive for your justice, and I strive for mine. We're both just ordinary men who have been driven to seek vengeance in the name of justice. And if one comes to call vengeance justice, such justice will only breed further vengeance and trigger a vicious cycle of hatred. Right now, we live in such a cycle. I know the past, and can foretell our future. It is the same as our history. So we believe that human beings simply cannot understand each other, and they never will. The shinobi world is ruled by hatred and hatred alone. So, Naruto, how would you confront this hatred in order to create peace? I want to know what your answer is.



We live in a world that demands purpose from people who were never given a reason to exist. From birth, we are fed illusions—dreams of success, love, recognition. We are taught to chase goals, smile through pain, believe in progress. But deep inside, we know it’s all temporary. Fleeting. Fragile. Meaningless. The truth is, life doesn’t care if we live or die. The universe isn’t watching. There is no grand story, no redemption arc. Just randomness. Just suffering stitched together with distractions. People cling to relationships hoping they’ll bring meaning. But even love dies. People leave. People change. People forget. What once felt eternal becomes awkward silence or forgotten memories. And no matter how much we give, it’s never enough to be remembered. Friends become strangers. Parents die. Children grow into replicas of the same miserable cycle. We die the same way we lived—quietly, confused, and alone. We pour our energy into work, art, status, hobbies. But all of it fades. In a hundred years, no one will remember us. Even if you build monuments, they crumble. Write books, they rot. Start revolutions, they get rewritten. History is just a biased version of selective memory. Our existence is reduced to dust particles floating through uncaring time. Pain stays. Regret lingers. Joy is a visitor. No matter how much we run, we cannot escape the weight pressing on our chest. No one tells you how pointless it all feels at 2 am when you’re alone, staring at the ceiling wondering why you’re still trying. The world romanticizes survival, but never tells you what you're surviving for. The world wants you to keep moving, keep buying, keep pretending. But what if I’m tired of pretending? Religion, philosophy, love—none of them fix the hole. They patch it up until it tears again. People don’t want truth. They want comfort. But some of us are cursed with awareness. We see through it. We can’t lie to ourselves forever. Life isn’t a gift. It’s a sentence. And the worst part? Most of us die before we ever figure out who we really are. I don’t fear death. I fear wasting time on things that mean nothing. I fear waking up old and realizing it was all noise. No purpose. No legacy. Just endless effort toward nothing. So I ask you—why does life matter? And if it doesn’t, why are we still pretending it does?




Rhea Ripley is revolutionizing the women’s division in wrestling by bringing a blend of power, charisma, and dominance that has never been seen before. She doesn’t simply step into the ring to compete—she steps in to control it, commanding the attention of everyone watching. Ripley’s raw strength, combined with her unmatched technique and fearless attitude, has set a new standard for women in WWE. Her physique alone is enough to demand respect; her muscular frame and imposing presence are not just built for show—they are built for destruction. She carries herself with the confidence of someone who knows she is the strongest in the room, and she uses that to dictate the pace and tone of every match. What makes Rhea Ripley so extraordinary is that she has completely broken the mold of what people expect from female wrestlers. She doesn’t rely on a "pretty face" or a "girly" persona to win over fans. Instead, she embraces her powerful body and unapologetic self, making no effort to hide her muscle or strength. Her look is fierce—her broad shoulders, toned arms, and athletic build showcase a woman who is both physically capable and mentally tough. She has redefined what it means to be a woman in wrestling, proving that femininity isn’t about being dainty or fragile—it’s about strength, power, and commanding presence. Her "mommyness" isn’t just about how she takes control inside the ring—it’s about how she carries herself outside of it. Ripley’s "mommyness" is a paradox: nurturing yet brutal, empathetic yet dominant. She has created a character that embodies the fierce protector, the strong maternal figure who will not allow herself or anyone she cares about to be weak or vulnerable. It’s not just a gimmick—it’s a true reflection of who she is, both as a wrestler and as a person. Her nurturing side comes through in the way she respects her opponents, but her dominance comes through when she makes it clear that no one can outmatch her. Rhea Ripley is reshaping how we view women’s wrestling. She’s not here to fill a quota or to play the supporting role—she’s here to lead. She’s made it clear that women’s wrestling isn’t just about being beautiful or charming; it’s about being skilled, powerful, and fully owning who you are. She’s not just the future of the division; she is the present. And the way she’s dominating proves that women’s wrestling has evolved from the days of being a sideshow attraction to becoming the main event. Ripley’s reign will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the most powerful in the sport, showing the world that women can—and should—take over the ring. She is not just a force to be reckoned with; she is the force that will shape the future of wrestling for years to come.


Anime has become a cultural phenomenon that has captured the hearts of millions worldwide, transcending language, culture, and age. What makes anime so great is its ability to tell stories that are both visually stunning and emotionally profound. Unlike many Western cartoons, anime covers a wide range of genres that appeal to every demographic. Whether it’s the action-packed drama of Attack on Titan, the philosophical themes of Neon Genesis Evangelion, or the heartwarming journey of Naruto, anime explores complex themes that can be thought-provoking, inspiring, and downright emotional. One of the unique qualities of anime is its ability to blend intricate storytelling with breathtaking animation. The visuals aren’t just there to entertain but to enhance the narrative, making every frame feel purposeful. The art style is often one of its most appealing aspects, with its vibrant colors, expressive characters, and fluid action sequences. Even in the most intense moments, anime knows how to create visuals that evoke the right emotions, whether it's a fierce battle or a quiet, introspective moment. Another reason anime stands out is the depth of its characters. Characters are often multi-dimensional and undergo significant growth throughout the story. In shows like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, One Piece, and Mob Psycho 100, characters face personal struggles, confront their weaknesses, and make tough choices. This level of character development makes them relatable, even if their circumstances seem fantastical. In a lot of anime, the characters feel real, despite being part of an exaggerated, fantasy world. Additionally, anime offers a diverse range of narratives that are often more mature than typical Western animation. Shows like Death Note and Attack on Titan tackle serious themes such as morality, the nature of power, and the consequences of war, presenting them in a way that is engaging and thought-provoking. These aren’t stories just for kids—they’re for anyone who’s looking for a deeper experience. Anime also stands out in its ability to create long, intricate storylines with complex world-building. Whether it’s the vast world of One Piece, the deep political intrigue of Attack on Titan, or the magical realms of Naruto, anime creates environments where viewers can immerse themselves completely. This world-building makes the stakes higher, the characters’ motivations clearer, and the narrative more gripping. At its best, anime creates a universe where the viewer becomes emotionally invested in the fate of the characters and the world they inhabit. Furthermore, anime has had an undeniable influence on the global entertainment industry. Its art style, storytelling techniques, and cultural references have inspired countless Western works, with shows like Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra drawing heavily from anime influences. Anime has bridged the gap between cultures, showing that good stories transcend borders, and its global impact continues to grow. Whether you're drawn in by the stunning animation, complex characters, or profound themes, anime offers a unique experience that captivates and resonates with audiences in ways that no other medium can. It's a form of entertainment that speaks to the heart and the mind, and that’s what makes it so great.



Messi is the greatest of all time, and there’s no argument strong enough to deny that. For years, he’s dazzled us with his genius on the pitch. While others rely on physicality, speed, or sheer force, Messi has always played with pure footballing intelligence. He doesn’t need to rely on unnecessary theatrics or screaming for attention. The way he controls the ball, the way he effortlessly dribbles past defenders, it’s as if he’s operating on a different level, almost like he’s operating in slow motion while everyone else is trying to catch up. There’s no denying that Ronaldo is a world-class athlete. His dedication and physical prowess are unmatched, and he has rightfully earned respect for his accomplishments. But at the end of the day, his game has always been about athleticism, power, and individual glory. Messi, however, has taken football to an art form. His vision on the field, his ability to create something out of nothing, and his understanding of the game set him apart. You can see it in every match, in every assist, in every goal. Messi doesn’t just score, he scores with purpose, with meaning, with vision. It’s like watching a masterpiece come together, and that’s what makes him special. The Ronaldo fanboys just don’t get it. They’ll scream and argue that their guy is the best, but deep down, they know that Messi’s elegance is unmatched. They’re so obsessed with numbers and records that they fail to appreciate the beauty of football, the way Messi plays it. They act like Ronaldo’s record-breaking stats automatically make him the greatest, but they forget that football is more than just stats. It’s about the moments, the magic, and Messi has delivered that time and time again. Messi doesn’t need to scream his name from the rooftops, he doesn’t need a flash of light or loud celebrations. His greatness is quiet, reserved, and graceful. Whether it’s his last-minute free kick or his ridiculous dribbling runs through a sea of defenders, he’s a magician. His ability to change the course of a match in an instant is unrivaled. Messi isn’t just a player; he’s a phenomenon, a once-in-a-lifetime talent that the world is lucky to witness. His consistency over the years is unparalleled, and he’s done it all with humility, which is something the loud and brash Ronaldo fanboys will never understand. They’ll never understand that greatness isn’t about making noise or drawing attention. It’s about making history, and Messi has done that in ways that no one else ever will. Messi has carried Argentina to the top, winning trophies for his country, and cementing his place in history as not only one of the greatest players of all time but as the greatest player of all time. So, while Ronaldo’s fanboys keep running their mouths, we Messi fans will keep watching in awe. We know who the real GOAT is, and it’s not a matter of opinion, it’s a fact. Messi is the king of football, and there’s no one who can come close to him.

You were not born with a barcode on your wrist, but somewhere along the way, they found a way to tag you. They didn’t need chains. They gave you apps. They didn’t need whips. They gave you likes. They didn’t need to force you. They convinced you. You started by posting photos to share moments. But you stayed because attention felt like love. Approval felt like meaning. And then, you started to change. Slowly. You began curating instead of living. Filtering instead of feeling. Cropping instead of confronting. Your life became a show. A performance. An audition for the gaze of people you don’t even know. Every thought you had began to feel like content. Every moment that once held intimacy now begged to be published. Your sadness became poetry for engagement. Your healing became a brand. You started dressing for stories, smiling for posts, and living for the next upload. You called it sharing. You called it authenticity. But it wasn’t. It was marketing. You were no longer just a person. You were a product. The platforms encouraged it. They rewarded the extreme. The beautiful. The broken. The viral. The platforms are not evil. They are empty. Hungry. Machines built to profit from your attention. They don’t care about your truth, your grief, your joy. They only care how long you stay. They feed you curated trauma. Engineered laughter. Manufactured opinions. You call it entertainment. You call it connection. But it is data extraction. You become predictable. Mappable. Sellable. You are not the customer. You are the inventory. They watch what you click, what you skip, what makes you stop scrolling for three seconds longer. They track your hesitation. Your rage. Your boredom. They know when you cry. They know when you spiral. They study you better than you study yourself. And then they sell that knowledge. Not once. But over and over. To advertisers, data firms, influencers, political campaigns. Your privacy was not taken. You gave it away. Freely. Gratefully. In exchange for a feeling of being seen. They turned your attention into a commodity. And when attention becomes currency, you begin to starve without it. You don’t know how to exist in silence anymore. You feel invisible if no one is watching. So you keep performing. You start to measure your worth in impressions. In numbers. In followers. You start tweaking your personality like a marketing strategy. You ask yourself: what will they like? Not: what do I love? You lose yourself. But you smile while doing it. Because the dopamine rush masks the decay. You monetize your passions. You monetize your hobbies. You even monetize your rest. You start waking up and thinking: should I post this? Instead of: how do I feel? You lose the ability to experience life without translating it into an audience-friendly narrative. You start writing captions in your head before the moment even ends. You start analyzing what version of you will perform best. And every time a post underperforms, it feels like a piece of you was rejected. Your relationships suffer. Not because you love less. But because your intimacy becomes interrupted by performance. You think about whether this text should be screenshotted. Whether this moment could go viral. Whether this pain is poetic enough to post. You begin to filter not just your photos, but your personality. You become digestible. Palatable. Marketable. And every part of you that doesn’t fit the algorithm begins to atrophy. The platforms change the way you think. Not just what you think. But how. You begin to reduce nuance to soundbites. Complexity to trends. Emotions to hashtags. You say something meaningful, and then you wait. For the likes. For the comments. For the algorithm to bless you. You don’t feel proud until you are seen. You don’t feel healed until you are validated. You don’t feel real until you are shared. The worst part is, you believe this is normal. Everyone is doing it. Everyone is building their brand. Everyone is performing. But just because it is common doesn’t mean it is human. This isn’t evolution. It’s extraction. You are being mined. And not just your data. Your time. Your dreams. Your attention. Your sense of self. The longer you stare into the screen, the more it stares back. Feeding you versions of yourself that you didn’t create. Feeding you fears to keep you scrolling. Feeding you shame to keep you consuming. The algorithm rewards the extreme. So you become more dramatic. More outrageous. More fragmented. You share more, feel less, and wonder why you are still so lonely. Because you are connecting through mirrors, not windows. You are reflected, but never touched. Seen, but never held. Followed, but never loved. You keep going because stopping feels like erasure. Like death. Like disappearing into the void. But maybe that’s the only way to survive. To disappear from the stage and return to yourself. To reclaim the parts of you that were never meant for an audience. The quiet thoughts. The private joys. The sacred grief. The parts of you that don’t trend. The parts of you that don’t perform well. The parts of you that are boring, messy, tender, unfiltered, human. You were never supposed to be a brand. You were supposed to be a person. Messy. Conflicting. Growing. Unstable. Alive. But now, even your healing has a template. Even your rebellion has a trend. Even your silence has a soundtrack. You can’t meditate without documenting it. You can’t cry without curating it. You can’t breathe without checking notifications. And all of it feels like choice. But it isn’t. It’s coercion dressed up as convenience. You didn’t sign up for this. You were born into it. And now you are drowning in it. And the worst part is, you don’t even know how to leave. Because to leave is to lose everything. Your connections. Your identity. Your perceived relevance. But what if losing all of that is what sets you free? What if freedom isn’t going viral? What if freedom is being unseen? Unknown? Unavailable? What if the most radical act in this world is to be fully yourself with no audience, no applause, no metrics? Just you. Breathing. Feeling. Failing. Healing. Alone. Alive. And unapologetically human.




You are born into a room that was never yours. The air already carries your name, your role, your limitations. Before you even learn to walk, your footsteps are charted. In Nepal, the family does not ask who you are, it tells you who to be. You are the son, the daughter, the future provider, the caretaker, the obedient child, the extension of everyone else's dream but never your own. And you are told this is love. You are told this is tradition. You are told this is sacred. You are not allowed to question it, because questioning family is seen as betrayal. But what if loyalty is not love? What if tradition is trauma wearing gold? What if obligation is not sacred but suffocating? In Nepal, family is everything. But that everything often means nothing for the self. You are expected to fold into their image of a good child. If you resist, you are selfish. If you speak your truth, you are ungrateful. Every act of independence is interpreted as rebellion, not growth. When you say no, they say you have forgotten your roots. But what they don’t understand is that roots are not chains. They are supposed to nourish, not trap. Yet, the way we romanticize obedience here is frightening. Especially for daughters, who are raised like a debt to be repaid, not individuals to be nurtured. Sons, on the other hand, are born with pressure carved into their shoulders, groomed to become sacrificial lambs for the family’s honor. Parents will often say, "We raised you, so you owe us." But love is not a loan. Nourishment is not a transaction. And no child asked to be born. Yet, you grow up being told your life belongs to them. Your dreams are filtered through their expectations. You are taught to study not what you love, but what brings status. You are told to marry when they decide, to settle where they want, to raise kids the way they dictate. And if you dare to live on your own terms, you are labeled corrupted by Western values, brainwashed by modernity. But is it modern to want to breathe freely? Is it Western to say, “This life is mine”? There is something deeply manipulative about how family obligation is weaponized in our culture. It is used to shame, to guilt, to suppress. Mental health is still a taboo. Saying you are depressed is seen as a luxury problem. Crying is weakness. Asking for space is disrespect. The house is crowded, but your heart feels empty. Your body lives in the same room as your family, but your soul feels exiled. You are not heard. You are managed. Told to keep quiet, to not make a scene, to think about what the neighbors might say. The worst tragedies in Nepalese households don’t happen in public. They happen in silence. Behind closed doors. In dinners shared with clenched jaws. In festivals that look happy on the surface but are rotten with resentment underneath. And when you finally gather the courage to leave — not because you hate them, but because you are suffocating — they call you selfish. They mourn as if you died. They whisper in the village that their child is lost, ruined, arrogant. But what they never admit is that they refused to let you grow. They never gave you the room to become more than a puppet. You were expected to serve, not soar. And when you break those expectations, the guilt becomes unbearable. Because we are raised to believe that duty is virtue, and that personal happiness is shameful. The truth is, not all family is love. Not all bonds are sacred. Some are toxic. Some are controlling. Some are abusive. And in Nepal, we don’t talk about that. We sweep it under the rug of “culture.” We hide it beneath the shawl of “tradition.” But what is tradition if it silences truth? What is family if it cages the soul? What use is a bond that bleeds you dry? Many people live entire lives for their parents, never for themselves. They grow up, get married, have children, work jobs they hate, and die quietly — all for the sake of maintaining harmony. But harmony built on suppression is not peace. It is performance. And what hurts more is that society claps for this performance. They praise the obedient son, the quiet daughter-in-law, the sacrifice, the compromise. But no one asks: at what cost? We are so obsessed with reputation that we forget to raise happy humans. We raise children like investments. We teach them that love must be earned. We make them feel like they owe us their existence. But true love does not demand proof. True family nurtures, it doesn’t dictate. It supports, it doesn’t suffocate. If a family cannot handle your truth, it does not deserve your silence. Even worse, these dynamics are replicated across generations. Traumatized parents raise traumatized children. Pain is passed down like inheritance. And everyone keeps pretending. Smiling for the Dashain photo. Bowing for tika. Offering blessings with lips sealed in resentment. It becomes a cycle of quiet suffering. No one breaks the pattern because the fear of being alone is greater than the desire to be free. But maybe it’s time we start redefining what family means. Maybe family is not just blood. Maybe family is anyone who allows you to be your full self without fear. Maybe love is not about duty, but freedom. Maybe tradition must evolve or be discarded. Maybe the truest form of respect is honesty. And maybe the most radical thing you can do in Nepal is to say, “No. I will not die in the name of obligation.” Your life is yours. Not your parents'. Not your caste's. Not your village’s. Not society’s. And if that truth makes you the villain in their story, so be it. You were not born to be worshipped by strangers and strangled by kin. You were born to live. And if that means burning a few bridges built on manipulation, burn them. There is no honor in drowning silently.




You were so small the first time I held you, barely the weight of my grief, and yet somehow heavier than every sorrow I had ever known. You came into this world crying, pink fists clenched, furious at the light, and I remember thinking, maybe he knows something the rest of us have forgotten. Maybe he remembers the place before this, before life became a series of disappointments and broken promises. I watched you sleep every night for years, just to make sure the world did not steal you away from me when I was not looking. I gave you everything, even the parts of me that no longer existed. You don’t know what it means to break yourself open so someone else can live a little lighter. You don’t know what it costs to smile when your chest is aching, to cook meals while your mind is starving, to lie and say you are fine when you want to scream at the walls. I tried to be both your shield and your wings. I tried to keep the storms from touching your skin. And maybe I failed, maybe I protected you so well you never learned how to stand in the rain without shivering. But I swear I did it because I wanted you to believe the world was gentle, at least for a while. You grew so fast. One day I was holding your tiny fingers, and the next, you were pulling your hand away. You stopped asking me to read to you. You stopped sitting beside me just to talk. And I know, I know, it is part of growing up. But no one warned me how silent the house would become when your laughter was no longer echoing in every corner. No one warned me how motherhood feels like a slow goodbye. You became your own person, and in doing so, I became a ghost in the background, watching you chase dreams I no longer understand, watching you fall in love with things I cannot name. Sometimes you speak to me like I am old, like I do not understand, like I am just someone who feeds you or lectures you or nags too much. And I take it, I swallow it whole, because I know this is the part where I am supposed to let go. But I want you to know I was someone before I became your mother. I was a woman with a voice and wild hopes and foolish fears. And even though the world forgot me in the process, I never forgot myself. I just set myself aside for you. And now I am asking, begging really, for you to see me again. Not as the woman who folded your laundry or made your school lunches, but as someone who loved you so much she became invisible to keep you safe. I know you have your own pain now. I see it in your eyes, in the way you stay out late or hide in your room, in the way your smile never reaches the corners of your mouth anymore. And I wish I could pull it from you like a thorn, take it and bury it somewhere deep, somewhere it can never find you again. But pain does not work like that. You have to carry it until it becomes a part of you, and I hate that. I hate that you are learning that now. If I could, I would build a world where your heart never cracked, where people never lied to you, where love did not leave without explanation. But I can’t. All I can do is remind you that even if everything else falls apart, I am still here. I will always be here. I don’t care how angry you get or how far you run. You are my blood. You are the only thing I ever got right. And if you ever wonder if you matter, if your voice is heard, if your pain is seen, remember me. Remember the woman who stayed up all night just to hold you when your body burned with fever. Remember the woman who skipped meals so you could eat your favorite dinner. Remember the way I whispered you are safe into your ear when the nightmares came. You are not alone. You were never alone. I may not be perfect. I may not understand your music or your words or your generation. But I understand what it means to love someone so deeply that it tears your soul into ribbons. I have felt your joy like sunlight. I have carried your sorrow like chains. I have watched you walk away a hundred times and prayed that each step brings you closer to the man you are meant to be. And when the world fails you, as it sometimes will, come home. Not just to the house, but to me. Come home to the arms that never stopped waiting. Come home to the woman who will still cook your favorite food even if you arrive at midnight. Come home and let me see your face, let me hold your hand, let me remind you that no matter how cold it gets out there, you were once cradled by love that asked for nothing but your breath. My son, my baby, my boy, if you forget everything else, remember this. I chose you. Every single day. Even when I was tired. Even when I was breaking. Even when the world told me I had nothing left. I chose you. And I will keep choosing you, over and over, until the last breath leaves my body.
