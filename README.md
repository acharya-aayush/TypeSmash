# TypeSmash 🗡️

Typing Smashers....check your typing speed...that's it.

## 🔥 What's this?
Just a typing game I built because normal typing tests are boring af. Two modes:

- **Regular typing test** - your standard WPM counter
- **Zoro Mode** - words fall from the sky, you type them, Zoro slashes them

## 👾 Difficulty Zones
Words in Zoro mode are categorized like One Piece power levels:
- **East Blue** – 3-letter baby words... training arc vibes
- **Paradise** – 4-6 letter words, mid-difficulty, mid-crew level
- **Warlord_Commander** – now it's serious, 7-8 letters, harder stuff
- **Yonko** – yeah bro these words bite back. long af. Zoro with both hands and a teeth grip.

## ⚔️ Features

- **Regular typing test** - 15 second timer or 20 word modes
- **Zoro mode** - slash falling words by typing them
- **Power-ups** - Onigiri (heal), Haki (invincibility), Ashura (screen clear)
- **Stats tracking** - see your progress (or lack thereof)
- **Sound effects** - because silence is boring
- **Custom word lists** - categorized by difficulty

## 🧃 How to Play

1. Go to [github pages link would be here]
2. Choose your mode (regular or Zoro)
3. Start typing
4. Don't suck (optional)

### Zoro Mode Controls
- Type the words to slash them
- Type "onigiri" to restore 1 life
- Type "haki" for temporary invincibility
- Type "ashura" to clear the screen

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Plain HTML, CSS, JS (kept it simple)
- Canvas-based rendering for Zoro mode
- JSON word list with 300+ categorized words
- No frameworks because I'm a purist (or lazy, take your pick)

## 📱 Mobile Support
Lol no. Maybe someday. Your phone keyboard would probably hate you anyway.

## 🎮 To-Do
- Add more sword animations
- More power-ups maybe?
- Luffy mode if I feel motivated
- Actually make it mobile friendly (don't hold your breath)
- Add difficulty settings that aren't hard-coded
