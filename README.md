## üöÄ Features

### Standard Typing Test

## üéÆ How to Use

## üéµ Audio System

The latest update includes significant improvements to the audio system:

- **Volume Balance**: Background music plays at 40% volume with sound effects at full volume
- **Audio Management**: Proper suspension of audio context when exiting game modes
- **Sound Preloading**: Improved loading with better error handling
- **Audio Feedback**: Enhanced sound effects for typing, power-ups, and game events

## ‚öñÔ∏è Power-up Balancing

The recent update rebalanced power-ups in Zoro Mode to improve gameplay:

- **Onigiri**: Now requires 5000 points (increased from 100)
- **Haki**: Now requires 1000 points (increased from 200)
- **Ashura**: Now requires 7500 points (increased from 350)

These adjustments create a more challenging progression system and prevent power-up abuse.

## üó°Ô∏è Oh, and there's Zoro Mode... (last minute addition)

A completely unplanned feature added in the final days of development. Words fall from the top of the screen, and you type them before they hit the bottom. Inspired by One Piece, because why not.

### Difficulty Tiers in Zoro Mode:
- East Blue ‚Üí Alabasta ‚Üí Skypiea ‚Üí Water 7 ‚Üí Enies Lobby ‚Üí and many more!
- Each tier increases word speed and difficulty
- Word length increases as you progress through levels

### Controls:
- Type the falling words to slash them
- Use power-ups by typing their names or pressing number keys:
  - "onigiri" or 1: Clear all words on screen (requires 5000 points)
  - "haki" or 2: Slow down words temporarily (requires 1000 points)
  - "ashura" or 3: Automatic word slashing for 5 seconds (requires 7500 points)

### Recent Fixes (v0.8.0):
