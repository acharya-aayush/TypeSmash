## Hey There! Please Read This:

This is just a personal project I made for fun, so feel free to:
- Use it for personal stuff
- Modify it (if you know what you're doing)
- Share it with friends
- Use it to improve your typing skills

But please DON'T:
- Use it for commercial purposes
- Claim it as your own work
- Remove this notice when sharing

## About the Cool One Piece Stuff:

This project contains sounds, images, and themes from One Piece (like Zoro Mode and sound effects) that I don't own:
- The "zorobattletheme.mp3" and other sounds are from One Piece
- Character images and references are from One Piece
- All One Piece content belongs to Eiichiro Oda, Shueisha, Toei Animation, and other rightful owners

I'm using these materials purely for fun and not making any money from them. This is a fan project only!

## No Warranty:

This project is provided "as is" without any warranty. Use at your own risk - but it's just a typing game, so you should be fine! ðŸ˜„
